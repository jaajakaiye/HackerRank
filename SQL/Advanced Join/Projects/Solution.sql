#You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date.
# It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for 
#each row in the table.


#Column      Type
#Task_ID     Integer
#Start_Date  Date
#End_Date    Date


#If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha 
#is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

#Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took 
#to complete the project in ascending order.

#If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by 
#the start date of the project.

#Sample Input

#Task_Id  Start_Date  End_Date
#1        2015-10-01  2015-10-02
#2        2015-10-02  2015-10-03
#3        2015-10-03  2015-10-04
#4        2015-10-013  2015-10-014
#5        2015-10-14  2015-10-15
#6        2015-10-28  2015-10-29
#7        2015-10-30  2015-10-31

#Sample Output
#2015-10-28 2015-10-29
#2015-10-30 2015-10-31
#2015-10-13 2015-10-15
#2015-10-01 2015-10-04

#Explanation

#The example describes following four projects:

#Project 1: Tasks 1, 2 and 3 are completed on consecutive days, so these are part of the project. 
#Thus start date of project is 2015-10-01 and end date is 2015-10-04, so it took 3 days to complete the project.

#Project 2: Tasks 4 and 5 are completed on consecutive days, so these are part of the project. Thus, the start date of project 
#is 2015-10-13 and end date is 2015-10-15, so it took 2 days to complete the project.

#Project 3: Only task 6 is part of the project. Thus, the start date of project is 2015-10-28 and end date 
#is 2015-10-29, so it took 1 day to complete the project.

#Project 4: Only task 7 is part of the project. Thus, the start date of project is 2015-10-30 and end date is 2015-10-31, 
#so it took 1 day to complete the project.
